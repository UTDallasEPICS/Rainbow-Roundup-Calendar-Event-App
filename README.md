## Conceptual Overview

Rainbow Roundup is a calendar event management platform designed to streamline student organization events at UT Dallas. It centralizes event discovery, RSVP management, and event moderation in one system. The platform supports different user roles to ensure efficient access control and functionality.

### User Roles:

- **Visitor**: Can browse the calendar and view event details
- **Registered User**: Can RSVP to events and manage their profile
- **Admin**: Can create, edit, and delete events; view RSVPs
- **Super Admin**: Can manage user roles, access analytics, and oversee the entire system
